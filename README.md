# HPC-Benchmark

This project aims to explore the performance, numerical reproducibility, and energy consumption of various programming languages, with a particular focus on High Performance Computing (HPC). 

The study covers a range of languages including C, C++, Erlang, Fortran, Python, Java, Ruby and Rust. 

### Benchmark resources

- The Computer Language Benchmarks Game (CLBG): [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Computer_Language_Benchmarks_Game)

These resources provide a foundation for understanding how different languages perform in various standardized tasks.


### Reproducibility measurement

Reproducibility will be assessed by comparing the output of the same algorithm implemented in different languages. 

For compiled languages, comparisons will include different compilation optimizations (e.g., -O1, O2, -O3). The study will also investigate the impact of advanced optimizations, such as out-of-order execution, on reproducibility.
